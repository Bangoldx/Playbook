                <h1>jQuery</h1>
  <p>
    jQuery is a javascript is a precompiled library meant to make our lives easier by requiring less typing. It is, in
    fact, very similar to how Bootstrap shortens certain CSS where once its linked to your HTML file you can use
    shorthand scripts to do things. Where a normal JS query requires document.querySelector("h1"), jQuery shortens it to
    jQuery("h1"), or even shorter still... $("h1"). Also like Bootstrap you can link the CDN to your HTML file which can
    be found <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries#jquery">here</a>
  </p>

  <h4>jQuery Manipulation</h4>
  <p>
    You can manipulate CSS elements using the .css method followed by the property you want to change and the value of
    the property. If you only put in the property inside the method it will allow you to find the current value. So,
  <p>$("h1").css("color","red");</p>
  will change the color of ALL h1 elements to red, and
  <p>console.log$("h1").css("color");</p>

  will give you the current value of the color property of the h1 element. So anytime that you only have one input, you
  are getting the value of that input and anytime that you have two inputs you are setting a new value. While you
  <em>CAN</em> change the style this way, its not recommended as you'd want to keep your concerns seperated. You can add
  and remove different styles using jQuery kind of like you would in JS but a little more simplified. You add/remove
  classes with .addClass(" "); or .removeClass(" "); after the element that you're trying to change and have the style
  class built out within your styles.css file. You can add multiple CSS classes to you jQuery code, and you do this by
  adding in the first class you want to access followed by the second seperated by a space, all within the same
  quotations. ("firstClass secondClass".</p>
  <p>
    You can changed the text within an element using jQuery using .text, and since the $ automatically select all of
    that element, all will change. Instead of innerHTML like we would use in JS you can just use .html and this will
    also add html to the element where if we were to try adding html using the .text method it would read any html
    simply as text and add it directly to the element.
  </p>
  <p>
    Changing different attributes is just as easy with jQuery, use the <strong>.attr</strong> method. Lets say that you
    wanted to change an image, you would select the img tag and then .attr and your first input is going to be the name
    of the attribute that we want and if there is a second input that is what we are going to change the attribute to.
    $(img).attr("src", "drum2.png").
  </p>

  <h4>Event Listeners</h4>
  <p>

  </p>
  <h4>Add/Remove Elements</h4>
  <p>
    before() adds the new element before the opening tag of the queried element. after() adds the new element after the
    closing tag of the queried element. prepend() adds the new element just before the the content of the queried
    element. append() adds the new element just after the content of the queried element.</p>
  <p>
    Getting rid of elements is just as easy, you query the element and use .remove() and this will remove all that
    element.
  </p>

  <h4> jQuery Animations</h4>
  <p>
    .hide .show .toggle .fadeOut .fadeIn, .fadeToggle .slideUp .slideDown .slidToggle .animate({opacity:0.5}), with
    animate you can only add the css rules that have a numeric value. You can chain animations together using the dot
    notation
