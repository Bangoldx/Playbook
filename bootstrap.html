    <h1>Bootstrap</h1>
    <p>
      <em>A Front-End Library</em>, bootstrap is a precompiled library of styles that can essentially be shortcutted to
      style your webpage. Bootstrap and its documentation can be found <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">here</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Bootstrap Installation</h3>
    <p>
      When you want to use the bootstrap framework, there are a few different ways that you can install it. You can just
      use the href link provided in the <strong><em><a
            href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/download">Get Started</a></em></strong>, you can
      download and include it in your package manager, or you can download the physical files to point to. The easiest
      option is to just use the href link, which is most likely cached on the user's systems already.
    </p>
    <h3>Workflow</h3>
    <p>
      One of the first things you should when you start designing a website is to start
      <strong><em>wireframing</em></strong>. This is just a low res quick sketch of what you're going to want your site
      to look like. You can do this just on a sheet of paper, or download and print templates from <a
        href="https://sneakpeekit.com">Sneakpeekit</a> or use an interactive too called <a
        href="https://balsamiq.cloud">Balsamiq</a>. After you wireframe your site and establish a design you're going to
      create a <strong><em>Mock Up</em></strong>, this is a more detailed and styled nonfunctioning wireframe of your
      site. You can do this with photoshop, illustrator or any other photo editing software.
    </p>
    <h3>Creating a Navigation Bar</h3>
    <p>
      You can create a navigation bar in bootstrap using the < nav> tag and creating a navbar class, class="navbar".
        Then create and unordered list with a class="navbar-nav" and list items with a class="nav-item". You would then
        want to create an anchor tag with a class="nav-link" href="" and name your tag with whatever you want it to say
        or to point to. You can also use a class="navbar-brand" href="" anchor tag and this will create a "brand" style.
        It can be created with multiple elements but it works best with the anchor tag.
    </p>
    <h4>Navbar Content Positioning</h4>
    <p>
      You change the positioning of your li by adding in spacing. Inside of your opening ul, you want to add an addition
      class after navbar-nav, you will use <strong><em>m</em></strong> for margin or <strong><em>p</em></strong> for
      padding. Then you can add a position where you want your spacing , ie..<strong><em>s</em></strong> for start.
      There are WAAAY to many options to list, so here's a <a
        href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/utilities/spacing/">link</a> ðŸ˜‰.
    </p>
    <h4>Navbar Hamburger(togglers)</h4>
    <p>
      You will notice you resize your page with a navbar, that the navbar items automatically stack. You can prevent the
      by adding a hamburger button that displays when the screen size reaches a certain size. You can grab the code <a
        href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/navbar/#toggler">here</a> which is <em>
        < button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#navbarTogglerDemo02"
          aria-controls="navbarTogglerDemo02" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle navigation">
          <span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span>
          < /button>
      </em>. Create a div with class="collapse navbar-collapse" and give it id="navbarTogglerDemo02". you can name your
      id whatever you like, it just has to match with what is in the button code for its target. </p>
    <p>
      div placement does matter as you only want the things in the div that you want to be collapsable. So if you want
      your brand to be outside of the hamburger after everything is collapsed then you would want to not include your
      navbar-brand inside your div. In order to get your hamburger to function in a web browser you will need the
      javascript script provided in <strong><em><a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/download">Get
            Started</a></em></strong>.
    </p>
    <h4> The Grid System</h4>
    <p>
      You create grids using div class="row" and div class="col". Onces you have your rows and collums, you can get more
      specific about the placement while static or responsive. Bootstrap has a prespecified alottment of 12 collums.
      Using col-1 thru 12 will allow you to chose how many of the 12 chunk each col takes up. You make your colums
      responsive, how it reacts at different sizes, using size tags. col(standard) col-sm(mobile) col-md(tablet)
      col-lg(laptop/desktop) and col-xl- col-xxl for things over 1440. You add multiple of these "classes" in with your
      div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12". For anything you're wanting to take up the full 12, you do not have to
      specify it as it is defaulted.
    </p>

    <h4>Bootstrap Containers</h4>
    <p>
      Containers allow you to "chunk" off different portions of your code, and you create them using
      <strong><em>class="container"</em></strong> These containers are automatically responsive, so as you change the
      size of your browser or viewing window, the container will automatically resize itself and jump between sizes.
      While effective, this is not pretty at all so you can also use <strong><em>class="container-fluid"</em></strong>
      in order to get rid of the jumpyness and make it a smooth transition.

    <h4>Bootstrap Carousels</h4>
    <p>
      The Bootstrap Carousel is basically like a slideshow, that you can code to play contantly or click next/prev and
      things of that nature. Carousels are created using multiple divs. div id="carouselExample" class="carousel slide".
      Carousels must have another div with class="carousel-inner" as well as div class="carousel-item", the first
      carousel-item must also have the class "active" after class="carousel-item active". Base code to create the
      buttons Can be found within this playbook code and is currently commented out.

      <!--<button class="carousel-control-prev" type="button" data-bs-target="#carouselExample" data-bs-slide="prev">
                    <span class="carousel-control-prev-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span>
                    <span class="visually-hidden">Previous</span>
                  </button>
                  <button class="carousel-control-next" type="button" data-bs-target="#carouselExample" data-bs-slide="next">
                    <span class="carousel-control-next-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span>
                    <span class="visually-hidden">Next</span>
                  </button> -->
    </p>

    <h4>Bootstrap Cards</h4>
    <p>
      Cards are smaller containers styled within the page that can have a header, body and foot. You build the card
      using a div class="card" style="width: ;". You can add an image at the top using an img tage with
      class="card-img-top". This should be placed under the initial card class and directly above the the div
      class="card-body". You add text within the card-body div using p class="card-text". Everything should be nested
      properly within the first div. Cards can be used in conjunction with BS grid system to allow for responsive
      functionality.

    </p>

    <h4>CSS Z-Index and Stacking Order</h4>
    <p>
      CSS has, along with x and y, a z axis that allows you to stack elements on top of one another, iving you the
      ability to "hide" elements behind others. Use z-index inside you CSS styling and give it and give it a possition.
      default position is 0, and anything above or below will be either above or below that default 0. You can go into
      the negative z-space as well but in most cases it will no longer be visable. Z-index items must be possitioned in
      order for it to work. At least 1 element must have a z-index greater than 1 to start stacking, but it is best to
      possition both, or as many as needed, to achieve the most customizable outcome.

    </p>

    <h4>Media Query Breakpoints</h4>
    <p>
      <strong><em>Media @ media < type>
            < feature></strong></em> <br>
      Media Query Breakpoints can be used as "IF" statements to a certain degree. Basically if you want a certain
      element on your website to change or do something specific once the browser hits a certain size, or when your site
      is printed, you can use @ media (max-width:992px) { Then select the element that you want to target { and tell it
      what you want it to do} You can also add multiple elements {to do what the query is instructing} }

    </p>

    <h4>Code Refactoring</h4>
    <p>
      Code refactoring is basically cleaning up you code so you are not repeating the same lines of code for different
      elements. For each element that has the same CSS styling, add a new class, that will be the same, to your HTML
      elements and then target that class in your CSS stylesheet. So anything that has the same color pallet could be in
      a class="color-section" so you wouldn't have to have the same bits of code repeated. Now if you have the
      class="color-section" on an element that is not going to be styled the same, styling it within the CSS will
      override it.
    </p>
    <h4>Combining Selectors</h4>
    <p>
      You can combine selectors in a few different ways. You can just add then in a line seperated by a comma, so h1,
      h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 and each of these selectors with have whatever style you give it. or you can use hieratchical
      selectors. There are two types of hierarchical selectors, ones with a space and one without. hierarchical
      selectors that have spaces are read right to left. Basically saying for this child WITHIN this parent do X, for
      example| # title .container-fluid {
      padding: 3% 15% 7%;
      text-align: left;
      }
      This first looks for the .container-fluid AND IF its WITHIN the # title parent, give it padding and align its text
      accordingly.<br>
      Ones without a space are read from left to right and will look for through the HTML for an element that has the
      class title AND the class container-fluid. # title.container-fluid {
      padding: 3% 15% 7%;
      text-align: left;
      } and will only apply the CSS if all conditions are met.
