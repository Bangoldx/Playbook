    <h1>APIs - Application Programming Interfaces</h1>
    <h3> What are APIs?</h3>
    <p>
        A set of commands, functions, protocols, and objects that programmers can use to create software or interact
        with an
        external system.
    </p>
    <h3>API Endpoints, Paths and Parameters</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Endpoints</strong>, every API that interacts with an external system like a server, will have an
        endpoint.
        Possibly a URL found within the documentation.

        <strong>Paths</strong> are just that and are included in the end point URL at the end. This tells the browser
        where
        in particular it needs to look within the endpoint to find what you are looking for. This can further be
        expanded on
        with the inclusion of <strong>Parameters</strong>. Parameters come after the path, proceeded by a "?" which is
        then
        followed by a key value pair seperated by a "=". You can have multiple queries inside your parameters and these
        will
        be seperated by a "&". The order of your parameters does not matter, you will still receive the same result.
    </p>

    <h3>Authentication</h3>
    <p>
        Authenication is how the API host knows how to either monetize or limit its use. Some even have a limit on how
        many
        times it can be called before it limits its output. This is done using an API key, provided by the host.
        Depending
        on your needs, they may be free of cost several thousands.
    </p>
    <h3>Postman</h3>
    <p>
        Postman is a program that helps simplify typing your API request. You can download on linux with snap.
        Essensintially giving you a "form" to fill out, starting with your endpoint and then gets you entry spots for
        keys
        and values and it will build out the full API url for you. Saving you the trouble of having to type everything
        into
        your browser.
    </p>
    <h3>JSON</h3>
    <p>
        Javascript Object Notation
    </p>

    <h3>Get Request</h3>
    <p>
        You use .get to gain access to the api url you are using. Node.js comes standard with the HTTPS module so there
        is
        no need to download something external and as such, you can just simply create an https const requiring
        ("https")
        and then use https.get. Now using this just like it is,
        https.get(https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat=38.5492&lon=-90.4926&units=imperial&appid={APIKEY}
        , function(res){}) can be a bit lengthy. So what you can do to help alleviate is create another const url =
        https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat=38.5492&lon=-90.4926&units=imperial&appid={APIKEY} and then
        your
        https.get(url) since const(s) act as var(s).
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>.on Method</strong> allows you to get data from the api response. Response.on("data", function(data){}).
        Just using this will create hexdecimal data that, when converted, will give you real data. However, you can
        actually
        pull a js object by parsing JSON. You will want to store the parsed json object inside of a const, so in this
        current project its, response.on("data", function(data){
        const weatherData = JSON.parse(data)
        }) which will effectively unpack and build the data for you. JSON.<strong>stringify?</strong>(data)
    </p>
