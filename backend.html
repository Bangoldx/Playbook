    <h1>Backend Web Developement</h1>
    <h3>Node.js</h3>
    <p>
        Node.js allows your code to interact directly with the computer. Node comes with built in modules, basically
        libraries of code to help with day to day code use. <strong>Const</strong> is kind of like var but stands for
        constant and is just that, so unlike vars it can not be changed like a var can.
    </p>
    <p><strong>REPL</strong> or <strong><em>Read Evaluation Print Loop</strong></em> allows you to write code directly
        in
        the terminal with immediate results.
    </p>
    <p>
        File system functionality, You can access the file system on a computer using node as mentioned previously. One
        of
        the main file system functions that you can do is copy files. Once you have your const fs set up with <em> const
            fs
            = require("fs");</em> you can then use fs.copyFileSync("source", "destination");, and this will make a copy
        of the
        source file and place it within the destination file, creating one if the destination file does not exist. It
        also
        appears that this will overwrite, without warning, anything that is in the destination file, should it already
        exist.
    </p>

    <h3>NPM Package Manager and External Packages</h3>
    <p>
        From the terminal, use the command "npm init", this will INITitalize a new .json package within your project
        folder.
        This, I believe, will house all your dependancies. Then following the prompts, you will set up your package.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Node Package Manager</strong> or <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">NPM</a> is a great place to find
        different
        packages that house different bits of commonly used code, so it can save you time having to rewrite code. Inside
        the
        package you find and want to use, there will be instructions on how to install and run the package. When you
        install
        the external package, it will add itself to your .json file as a dependency.
    </p>

    <p>
        npm nodemon will automatically monitor your server and restart it whenever there are new changes implemented.
        Install it using npm install -g nodemon, if an error occurs, runs as sudo.
    </p>

    <h3> Express.js with Node.js</h3>

    <p>
        Express is a Node framework and can allow you to create a server, among other web developments. Once you have
        your
        project file folder setup and have your .js file created, from the terminal you'll install it just like any
        other
        package manager, <em>npm install express</em>. This will create a package.json file within your project. Inside
        your
        .js file, create a const express = require("express");<em> the "" for "express" are extremely important and your
            server will error and not run if they are not there!</em> and const app = express();. Now the usage of "app"
        is
        just a best practice to allow anyone else that views your code to know whats going on.

    <h3>Methods with Express</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>app.get("/", function(request<em> or req</em>, response<em> or res</em>){}) The "/" stands for the home
            route.

        <li>app.listen(3000)</li>
        <li>app.post()</li>
        <li>app.use()</li>
        <li>res.send()</li>
        <li>res.sendFile(__dirname + "/fileName")
    </ol>
