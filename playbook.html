  <h1>Command Line Techniques</h1>
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li>List Items - ls</li>
    <li>Change Directory - cd</li>
    <li>Make Directory - mkdir</li>
    <li>Create File - touch</li>
    <li>Open File - open</li>
    <li>Open File in Specific Application - open -a</li>
    <li>Delete Files - rm</li>
    <li>Delete All Files - rm *</li>
    <li>Remove Directory - rm -r</li>
    <li>Print Working Directory - pwd</li>
  </ul>
  Alta+click moves your cursor to where you clicked within the command line. CTR+A takes cursor to beginning of command
  line, CTR+E takes cursor to the end. CTR+U clears currently written command.

  <h1>Backend Web Developement</h1>
  <h3>Node.js</h3>
  <p>
    Node.js allows your code to interact directly with the computer. Node comes with built in modules, basically
    libraries of code to help with day to day code use. <strong>Const</strong> is kind of like var but stands for
    constant and is just that, so unlike vars it can not be changed like a var can.
  </p>
  <p><strong>REPL</strong> or <strong><em>Read Evaluation Print Loop</strong></em> allows you to write code directly in
    the terminal with immediate results.
  </p>
  <p>
    File system functionality, You can access the file system on a computer using node as mentioned previously. One of
    the main file system functions that you can do is copy files. Once you have your const fs set up with <em> const fs
      = require("fs");</em> you can then use fs.copyFileSync("source", "destination");, and this will make a copy of the
    source file and place it within the destination file, creating one if the destination file does not exist. It also
    appears that this will overwrite, without warning, anything that is in the destination file, should it already
    exist.
  </p>

  <h3>NPM Package Manager and External Packages</h3>
  <p>
    From the terminal, use the command "npm init", this will INITitalize a new .json package within your project folder.
    This, I believe, will house all your dependancies. Then following the prompts, you will set up your package.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Node Package Manager</strong> or <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">NPM</a> is a great place to find different
    packages that house different bits of commonly used code, so it can save you time having to rewrite code. Inside the
    package you find and want to use, there will be instructions on how to install and run the package. When you install
    the external package, it will add itself to your .json file as a dependency.
  </p>

  <p>
    npm nodemon will automatically monitor your server and restart it whenever there are new changes implemented.
    Install it using npm install -g nodemon, if an error occurs, runs as sudo.
  </p>
  
  <h3> Express.js with Node.js</h3>

  <p>
    Express is a Node framework and can allow you to create a server, among other web developments. Once you have your
    project file folder setup and have your .js file created, from the terminal you'll install it just like any other
    package manager, <em>npm install express</em>. This will create a package.json file within your project. Inside your
    .js file, create a const express = require("express");<em> the "" for "express" are extremely important and your
      server will error and not run if they are not there!</em> and const app = express();. Now the usage of "app" is
    just a best practice to allow anyone else that views your code to know whats going on.
    <strong>body-parser</strong>⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
  </p>

  <h3>Methods with Express</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>app.get("/", function(request<em> or req</em>, response<em> or res</em>){}) The "/" stands for the home route.

    <li>app.listen(3000)</li>
    <li>app.post()</li>
    <li>app.use()</li>
    <li>res.send()</li>
    <li>res.sendFile(__dirname + "/fileName")
  </ol>

  

  <h1>APIs - Application Programming Interfaces</h1>
  <h3> What are APIs?</h3>
  <p>
    A set of commands, functions, protocols, and objects that programmers can use to create software or interact with an
    external system.
  </p>
  <h3>API Endpoints, Paths and Parameters</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Endpoints</strong>, every API that interacts with an external system like a server, will have an endpoint.
    Possibly a URL found within the documentation.

    <strong>Paths</strong> are just that and are included in the end point URL at the end. This tells the browser where
    in particular it needs to look within the endpoint to find what you are looking for. This can further be expanded on
    with the inclusion of <strong>Parameters</strong>. Parameters come after the path, proceeded by a "?" which is then
    followed by a key value pair seperated by a "=". You can have multiple queries inside your parameters and these will
    be seperated by a "&". The order of your parameters does not matter, you will still receive the same result.
  </p>

  <h3>Authentication</h3>
  <p>
    Authenication is how the API host knows how to either monetize or limit its use. Some even have a limit on how many
    times it can be called before it limits its output. This is done using an API key, provided by the host. Depending
    on your needs, they may be free of cost several thousands.
  </p>
  <h3>Postman</h3>
  <p>
    Postman is a program that helps simplify typing your API request. You can download on linux with snap.
    Essensintially giving you a "form" to fill out, starting with your endpoint and then gets you entry spots for keys
    and values and it will build out the full API url for you. Saving you the trouble of having to type everything into
    your browser.
  </p>
  <h3>JSON</h3>
  <p>
    Javascript Object Notation
  </p>

  <h3>Get Request</h3>
  <p>
    You use .get to gain access to the api url you are using. Node.js comes standard with the HTTPS module so there is
    no need to download something external and as such, you can just simply create an https const requiring ("https")
    and then use https.get. Now using this just like it is,
    https.get(https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat=38.5492&lon=-90.4926&units=imperial&appid={APIKEY}
    , function(res){}) can be a bit lengthy. So what you can do to help alleviate is create another const url =
    https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat=38.5492&lon=-90.4926&units=imperial&appid={APIKEY} and then your
    https.get(url) since const(s) act as var(s).
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>.on Method</strong> allows you to get data from the api response. Response.on("data", function(data){}).
    Just using this will create hexdecimal data that, when converted, will give you real data. However, you can actually
    pull a js object by parsing JSON. You will want to store the parsed json object inside of a const, so in this
    current project its, response.on("data", function(data){
    const weatherData = JSON.parse(data)
    }) which will effectively unpack and build the data for you. JSON.<strong>stringify?</strong>(data)
