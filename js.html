                    <h1>Javascript</h1>
                    <p>
                      Javascript is what gives your website functionallity. Without it, sites like youtube and netflix will not even
                      load. Any ad you see on a site is created using javascript and can be removed by removing javascript viewing in
                      your browser but that will also remove a whole other chunk of funtions from the site as well. adding a pop up into
                      your site is written as <strong><em>alert("Hello"); </strong></em> where the "alert" is the function, followed by
                      parentheses("and the message you want displayed within quotes inside the parentheses") and closed off with a ;.
                    </p>
                
                    <h3>Data Types</h3>
                
                    <p>
                    <h4>Strings</h4>
                    A <strong>String</strong> is what is betwen the quotation marks. This allows the computer to know what needs to be
                    displayed. You can find out the total length of a string or var value with varName.length. You can also change the
                    text casing of a string using either varName.toUpperCase or varName.toLowerCase, and this can be combined with var
                    slicing.
                    </p>
                
                    <h4>Numbers</h4>
                    <p>
                      You can add or subtract in JS simply using + or -, you can multiply with * and divide with /. And then there is
                      <strong>Modulo</strong> which gives you the remainder of a divised number. This is done using %. So 9 % 6 = 3
                      since 6 goes in to 9 once and the remainder is what is left over, which is 3. Mathmatically precidence still hold
                      true in programming so the normal order of operations will be used. Unlike basic math, programming also uses
                      increment and decrement expressions. Using <strong>x++</strong> where x=5, x would then equal 6, this is an
                      increment expression, decrement expressions are the same just with <strong>x--</strong> now x is equal to 4. You
                      also do this with more than just a single increment/decrement by using x +=2 so x would then equal 7. This can be
                      done with +, -, *, or /
                    </p>
                
                    <h4>Boolean</h4>
                    <p>
                      <strong>Boolean</strong> differentiates <em>True</em> or <em>False</em>
                    </p>
                
                    <h4> Javascript Variables</h4>
                    <p>
                      <strong><em> var(keyword) myName(name) = "Andrew"(value);</strong></em>, using the keyword var, you can create a
                      variable. You can name that var whatever you need to, camelCase is a best practice here so keep that in mind, and
                      then make that = to whatever you need it to be. Whether that be a string, or a number, or a boolean. Once this var
                      is created, it can be changed at anytime in the code by simply inputting the var name = theNewValue. You can even
                      combo var creation with a prompt such as <strong><em>var yourName = prompt("What is your name?";</strong></em>.
                      Once you have vars in place you can call those in different things like alerts using strings the a "+" and then
                      the var name, and you can combine those as many times as needed. as long as you have the proper syntax.
                    </p>
                
                    <h4>Naming Coventions</h4>
                    <p>
                      There are a few basic rules when it comes to variable names. Give your var meaningful names, it can not be named
                      var *, can not start with a number, can not include a space *, can only contain: letters, numbers $ and _ *, use
                      cameCasing. * = will error out and tell you its not valid.
                    </p>
                
                    <h4>Concatenation</h4>
                    <p>
                      Concatenation is combining multiple strings into a single output. You do this by adding a "+" between "strings",
                      so "string " + "string" will output "string string"
                    </p>
                
                    <h4>Slicing</h4>
                    <p>
                      <strong><em>varName.slice(0,x)</strong></em>, Slicing allows you to cut off or segment specific chunks of a string
                      based on its character count. Using varName.slice(0,x) where "0" is the very first character since in programming
                      all counts start at 0, and "x" is the amount of characters between the first slice and the last. Now, you can
                      start your slice at any point and end at any point so it could be varName.slice(42,97) and it would start counting
                      at the 42nd character and stop after the 97th.
                    </p>
                
                    <h3>Functions</h3>
                    <p>
                      Funtions are created using <strong><em>function functionName() {}</strong></em> and allows you to save a series of
                      code instructions so if you have to use the same series of instructions again don't have to rewrite them
                      everytime. Instead all you'll have to do it "call" the function with functionName();. function is, of course, the
                      keyword just like var so the computer knows what it needs to do, name it whatever you like within the naming
                      convention restrictions, <em>see above</em>, and a set of () followed by {Anything inside these curly braces is
                      going to be the code that your function performs when it is called}. Function curly braces do not need to be
                      closed with ";" but when calling it functionName(); it does. Functions can also be called within other functions.
                    </p>
                
                    <h4>Calling Functions</h4>
                    <p>
                      You call functions simply with functionName();, but can also become more indepth by adding different parameters
                      within the () when creating the function. So by creating function getMilk(money,costPerBottle) we can specify what
                      the parameters are when we actually call it. Now this is in combination with other code and functions so on its
                      own will not run. <em>buuuut</em> using <br>
                    <p>
                      function getMilk(money,costPerBottle){<br>
                      console.log("buy " + calcBottles(money,costPerBottle) + " bottles of milk.");<br>
                      console.log("here is your $" + calcChange(money,costPerBottle) + " change");<br>
                      }<br>
                      <br>
                      function calcBottles(startingMoney,costPerBottle){<br>
                      var numberOfBottles = Math.floor(startingMoney / costPerBottle);<br>
                      return numberOfBottles<br>
                      }<br>
                      <br>
                      function calcChange(startingAmount,costPerBottle){<br>
                      var change = startingAmount % costPerBottle;<br>
                      return change <br>
                      }<br>
                      getMilk(5,1.5);
                    </p>
                    We are able to call the returned outputs using the functions we created with the equations within the "string" that
                    we are logging to the console, so that with the parameters givin of (5,1.5) when calling the primary function it
                    would give the result of <em>buy 3 bottles of milk. here is your $0.5 change</em>. Understanding that I was needing
                    to create a function/equation just to get the output <strong>just</strong> to be able to use it in a seperate
                    function made so angry until it click. I was returning a value with the <strong>return</strong> keyword within the
                    function to use within my main function.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Randomness</h4>
                    <p>
                      True randomness is impossible with a computer, it's just simply not built to allow it. We can however create the
                      <em>illusion</em> of randomness. Using <strong><em>Math.random();</strong></em> we can create a random number
                      within 16 decimile points from 0-0.9999999999999999 but never reaching 1. You can modify this by multiplying it by
                      anynumber. You can also round to the floor or just simply round.
                    </p>
                    <h4>If/Else statements and Comparators/Equality</h4>
                    <p>
                      You can have your code do "if's" or "else's" by using the if and else keywords. So use <em>if(argument goes here
                        // comparator){ do this line of code}</em>
                      else{ do this line of code}
                      <br>
                      <strong>
                        Is equal to(===)<br>
                        Is not equal to(!==)<br>
                        Is greater than(>)<br>
                        Is Lesser than(<)<br>
                          Is greater or equal to(>=)<br>
                          Is lesser or equal to(<=)<br>
                      </strong><br>
                      "else if" is another comparator that will allow you to
                
                      <hr>
                      
                      <hr>
                
                    <h4>Combining Comparators</h4>
                    && AND<br>
                    || OR<br>
                    ! NOT<br>
                    </p>
                    <h4>Collections and JS Arrays</h4>
                    <p>
                      An array is basically a collection of data points with a []. You create a var equalling the array with the data
                      inside the [] seperated by commas. You can pull specific points by calling the numbered position within the array,
                      remember the first piece of data is 0. You can also check to see if a specific piece of data is included using
                      arrayName.includes(), you can combine this with prompts and alerts . <br>
                
                    <p>
                      var guestList = ["Drew", "Jared", "Brent", "Stanze", "Shaunta", "Christian"];<br>
                      var guestName = prompt("What is your name?")<br>
                      if (guestList.includes(guestName)){
                      alert ("Welcome to the party " + guestName + "!");<br>
                      } else{<br>
                      alert("Get lost loser!")<br>
                      }
                    </p>
                
                    <strong> Push and Pop your arrays</strong> using arrayName.push() or arrayName.pop() and what ever you put in the
                    parenthesis, which could be another var if needed.
                    </p>
                    <h4>LOOPS</h4>
                    <p>
                      <strong><em>"While Loops"</strong></em> lets you give the code to do a certain set of code as long as the stop
                      critera is not met. Such as while(count <= 100){}, this says while the var count is less than or equal to 100 do
                        {this code} and it will continue this loop until it reaches a <em>false</em> statement. Which also makes it
                        prone to errors and infinite loops that will cause you browser to "hang" and crash. Example of code commented
                        out in this code below.<br>
                        <!--     var output = [];
                    var count = 1;
                
                    function fizzBuzz() {
                
                    while(count <= 100){
                
                    if (count % 3 === 0 && count % 5 === 0){
                        output.push("FizzBuzz");
                    } else if (count % 3 === 0){
                        output.push("Fizz");
                    } else if (count % 5 === 0){
                        output.push("Buzz");
                    } else {
                        output.push(count);
                    }
                    count++;
                    }
                    console.log(output);
                } -->
                    </p>
                    <strong>for loops</strong>
                    <p>
                      for (i=0 "this is the start"; i<2 "this is the end" ; i++ "this is what we are changing each loop" ){do something}
                        var creation takes takes place within the for loop as the starting point, fizzbuzz example in code below. <!--
                        var output=[]; function fizzBuzz() { for(var count=1; count < 101; count++){ if (count % 3===0 && count %
                        5===0){ output.push("FizzBuzz"); } else if (count % 3===0){ output.push("Fizz"); } else if (count % 5===0){
                        output.push("Buzz"); } else { output.push(count); } } console.log(output); } -->
                        This is the most preferred looping method. <strong>While loops</strong> are to check states, and <strong>for
                          loops</strong> are used to iterate
                    </p>

                    <h1>DOM(Document Object Model)</h1>
                    <h4>Adding JS to Websites</h4>
                    <p>
                      You can add JS to websites very simarly to CSS and add it <em>inline</em> to the element. <strong>onload</strong>
                      tells the browser that when the element loads do "x". So
                
                      <body onload="alert(" Hello")"> Would create an alert stating "hello" when the body is loaded. However because the
                        alert command has to be inside of quotations and the string that we are trying to use does as well the browser
                        reads "alert(" and ")" as string and Hello as code. You rectify this by instead using single quotes
                        "alert('Hello')". Avoid inline JS if possible. <strong>Internal JS</strong> is created using the < script> tag.
                          < strong > External JS</strong > is just like external CSS and is done using < script src = "" charset = utf - 8 >
                            < /script>. Placement of the script tag is VERY important, as a best practice is to put the script tag at
                              the very end.

                    <h4>Using the DOM</h4>
                    <p>
                      The DOM allows you to pick and chose parts of your HTML files and change it on the fly. It reads your HTML
                      document as a tree structure and seperates each element as its own branch. At the top of the tree is the document,
                      then the HTML element, then the head and the body. This will continue for as many different elements that you have
                      inside your doc. You can select your tree's branches by using document.firstElementChild would select the HTML
                      element, and you can continue this for any child within any element'. document.querySelector(" ") will search
                      through your entire document looking for what is put within the quotations. then using the "dot notation ." and
                      you give it a method. Objects within the DOM can have Properties and Methods properties describe the object and
                      methods define things the element can do. <strong>Get Property</strong> car.color; would output the property color
                      of the element. <strong>Set Property</strong> allows you to change the property itself. So car.numberOfDoors = 0;
                      would then make it so that the car element has no doors.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Selecting HTML Elements with JS</h4>
                    <p>
                      You can use querySelector("") to select a single specific item wtih JS. Using querySelector you can combine
                      elements, classes and IDs just like you would with CSS. Now if you were wanting to select all the items that have
                      the element or class name, you would use querySelectorAll(""). This will then put all the items into an array. You
                      can also use getElementsByTagName("");. This will collect all elements with that tag and add them to an array. You
                      can select an item out of that array with document.getElementsByTagName("li")[2], which will select the 3rd item
                      in the array since arrays start at 0, then using the dot notation tell it what to do. So,
                      document.getElementsByTagName("li")[2].style.color = "purple"; would change the third li to purple.
                      getElementsByClassName("") and getElementById(""), the big difference between the tagName, className and the Id is
                      that element is singular in the Id. Because of course IDs are unique and can on be used once in a single HTML
                      file.
                    </p>
                
                    <h4>Manipulation of Stlyes Using JS</h4>
                    <p>
                      You can manipulate styles using JS. First you would select the element you're wanting to change, then use
                      style.whatPartYouWantToChange = "". The style keywords in JS are almost identical to those in CSS, with the key
                      difference being that instead of the words being seperated with a -, they are camelCased. So the first letter of
                      the first word is lower and then any later words will have their first letter capitalized. such as,
                      document.querySelector(".btn").style.backgroundColor = "yellow";.
                    </p>
                
                    <h4>Seperation of Concerns</h4>
                    <p>
                      HTML is for content only, CSS is to style your site, and JS is for behaviour. <strong>classList</strong> lets you
                      see all the classes within the selected element, using classList you can also add, remove, and toggle new classes
                      into your code. If you already have the CSS styles for those classes, the style will automatically be applied.
                      Just ensure that your query item is in " " as well as the class you are effecting.
                    </p>
                
                    <h4>Text Manipulation</h4>
                    <p>
                      You can change the text of your HTML doc with JS by using the .innerHTML tag. This will print anything within the
                      selected element, including any other HTML tags that may be included. If you just want the text, you would use
                      .textContent instead, this will only pull the actually text and not any HTML elements.<br>
                      You can view and change any attribute using JS as well, using .attributes You will get a list of all attributes
                      within your selected element. You can .getAttribute("") to get what the content of the attribute is, and you can
                      even .setAttribute(" ", " ")
                    </p>
                
                    <h4> Advanced JS and DOM Manipulation</h4>
                    <p>
                      Event Listener .addEventListener(type, listener"which is a function you have created to handle the event, );
                      <strong>Higher Order Functions</strong> which refers to the function that takes functions as inputs.
                
                      <strong>Callback Functions</strong>
                
                      A method is just a function that is associated with an object
                      <strong><em>This</strong></em> allows you to find the identity of the event listener that it active.
                    </p >
                    <p>
                
                      <strong>Adding Audio</strong> You add audio using the following code, var audio = new Audio('sounds/tom-1.mp3')
                      audio.play();. So you create a new var audio = new Audio, which "new Audio" is already an HTML element that is
                      prebuilt, followed by the file location and name. Very similar to an image.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <h4>Constructor Functions</h4> These are functions that act kind of like a factory. You can create it very similarly
                    to any other function bt with some tweak. So basically<br>
                    function HouseKeeper "the function name must have each word capitalized, ignoring the camelCase"(peram1, peram2,
                    peram3){<br>
                    this.peram1 = peram1<br>
                    this.peram2 = peram2<br>
                    this.peram3 = peram3<br>
                    }<br>
                    And you would call this function with <br>
                    var houseKeeper1 "camelCase back in play" = HouseKeeper(peram1, peram2, peram3);<br>
                    This is going to create the var houseKeeper1 with the perameters given without having to write out each FULL new var
                    with all the different perameters/arguments each time.
                    </p>
                
                    <h4>Switch</h4>
                    <p>
                      A switch will take the code in a different direction based on different variables, So you first create the var
                      that is going to be its basis. After you create the var, it goes in the "key" portion of the switch skeleton. The
                      case is next and that is going to corralate with the var you created, such if the var create was var =
                      buttonInnerHTML = this.innerHTML,<em>which as we know "innerHTML" is JS code to pull text from within code</em>,
                      Your case would be whatever innerHTML you need it to be to trigger the event listener. Case is built a lot like a
                      function, so you could create additional var and give any instruction you need to before the break; which act just
                      like a ; at the end of a line in a function.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      switch (key) {<br>
                      case value:<br>
                      <br>
                      break;<br>
                      <br>
                      default:<br>
                      break;<br>
                      }
                    </p>
                
                    <h4>Animations</h4>
                    <p>
                      There is a way to create animations with JS. You would use the classList and the add/remove methods in order to
                      add/remove different styles, but at its base that is just going to change it until the code tell it to change it
                      to something different. So in order to create an animation, you have to the setTimeout function. This requires two
                      perameters, the first is going to be the action that gets taken, which can be an annonomous function, followed by
                      a comma and the amount of time before timeout takes place. So <br>
                      setTimeout(function(){"your action taken goes here."}, 100);<br>
                      The number is milliseconds, and 1000 === 1 sec.
                    </p>
                  </div>
                
              
            </body>
        </html>
