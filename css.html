                    <h1>CSS</h1>
                    <strong>Cascading Style Sheets</strong> ~ You can change the style of your webpage by using CSS. <br>
                    Backgrounds, can be changed using the style tag, <br>
                    <code> style="background-color:red;"</code>
                    <br>
                    If you want something to be styled over the entire project, you can create a style and /style> entry within the
                    head below the title portion of your HMTL code. Within the style block of code you can designate what
                    elements of the code you want to adjust with out have to go through each individual instance of that
                    element. Such as body, hr, etc. Each element you want to style has to be coded seperate but will effect
                    all instances within the file. This is called <strong>internal CSS</strong> and
                    They are written as such:<br><br>
                
                    <pre>
                              body { background-color:red;
                              }
                
                              hr { border-style: none;
                              background-color: red;
                              height: 2px;
                              }
                              </pre>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>External CSS</strong> Allows you to bring in a stylesheet from a .CSS file into your HMTL file.
                    Use the <code>link</code> tag to link your css to your html. Do this by <code>link rel="stylesheet"
                                  href="*file location*"</code>. In the external CSS file you can create css stylings for any element
                    you have
                    through your entire HTML project. Just make sure you place the < link> tag in your < head> under your
                        < title>.

                          <h1>CSS Priority</h1>
                
                          <p>
                            When using CSS, it is possible to bug your code by having CSS code in multiple place. CSS code
                            priority is:
                          </p>
                
                          <p>
                          <ol>
                            <li><strong>Inline CSS</strong>-<em>CSS code within the element itself.</em></li>
                            <li><strong>Internal CSS</strong>-<em>CSS code written for an element inside a < style> tag
                                  inside the < head></em></li>
                            <li><strong>External CSS</strong>-<em>Your seperate CSS style file. Linked to your HTML files
                                using < link rel="stylesheet" href="filelocation > under the < title > portion of the HTML < head >"
                                  </em>
                            </li>
                          </ol>
                          </p>
                
                          <p>
                            In <strong>external</strong> CSS files, more specific instructions get priority over less
                            specific instructions. Classes and IDs will override standard tags in styling giving you more
                            options to style your site.
                          </p>
                
                          <p>
                            As a best practice when coding with CSS is it is best to do all your CSS styling in an
                            external .CSS file.
                          </p>
                
                          <h1>CSS Syntax</h1>
                
                          selector(who){property(what):value(how);}
                
                          <br>
                
                          <p>
                            The <em>selector</em> is going to be your element or <strong>class</strong>. Your property is
                            what you're changing, such as your color, background, borders and more. Your Value, or how, is
                            going to determine in what way you are changing the property of your selector. CSS Values must
                            be opened with ":" and closed with ";"</p>
                
                          <h3>Class <em>Selectors</em></h3>
                
                          <p><strong>Classes</strong> help making individual parts of the code styled. Adding (class="x")
                            after your element name effectively create a sub element. You access them in CSS by adding a
                            full stop "."before the class name. This allows you to modify just the class instead of the
                            entire element. You're going to use this tag when grouping related items. You can have
                            multiple classes for a particular elemement. i.e. < img class="broccoli circular"> will create
                              the style for the classes "broccoli" as well as the class "circular".
                          </p>
                
                          <h3>ID Selectors</h3>
                
                          <p>
                            IDs are created within the opening tag with " id="heading". These are called in your CSS file
                            using the "#" symbol.
                          </p>
                
                          <p>
                            Use to identify where there is only a single instance and use it when you want to create a
                            specific style for a single item.
                            Any given ID can only be used once, the system will not allow a second instance of this ID,
                            you will have to create a different ID in order to continue. You can not have more that one ID
                            for a single element. IDs are more selectively used in the wild.
                          </p>
                
                          <h3>Pseudo Selectors</h3>
                
                          <p>
                            Pseudo selectors have a ":", CSS elements can have different states, ie img:hover
                            {background-color:gold;} would cause the background of an image that the mouse is hovering
                            over to change color.
                          </p>

                            Favorite icon, what shows up in the left side of the tab. Can be created at favicon.cc, Use < link> with a
                              rel="icon" and a href="favicon.ico". If your browser still does not show your
                              favicon, change the href to href="favicon.ico?v=2"

                          <p>
                            <em>a content division element</em>
                            < div> Allows you to divide you content in to seperate containers or boxs and style them
                              seperatly. Must be opened and closed.<br>
                              You can use CSS to alter the sizes of margins for any element.
                              <p>
                                <hr>

                                This is very useful when creating a box with different sized borders, padding, and
                                margins. You may also specify a side with margin-top: Xpx; padding-right: Xpx;
                                border-bottom:<em>solid</em> Xpx; margin-left: Xpx;, or any variation of element modifiers

                                CodePen is not allowing the style to show properly, but if you look in the CSS section of

                                <strong>Block</strong> elements take up the whole space on the screen, preventing any
                                other elements from sitting next to it. We have seen block elements already, such as:

                                <strong>Inline</strong> (display:inline;) elements are those that can be placed side by
                                side on the same line. Like < span> (opened and closed) which allows you to create a box
                                  within a box for specific styling. < Span>s can be nested withing other elements or
                                    created seperate.

                                use the <em>visibility: hidden;</em> CSS style to remove it from the screen but keep its
                                box, which may be useful depending on what you're trying to do.

                              position base on the "parent" element such as the < div>. <strong>Fixed</strong> allows you
                                to position something in a permanent position that will allow you to scroll and keep the
                                fixed element where it is, depsite all the scrolling.

                              CSS code. You can also "font fallbacks". This basically specifies that you want font-family:
                              "Times New Roman", Times, serif; From left to right, the first is the first option and the
                              last is the last option.
                          </p>
                
                          <h3>Font-Sizing</h3>
                          <p>
                            You can change the font sizing but using the font-size:""; code inside you CSS. Now, you can
                            adjust this as a <strong>Static</strong> element by specifying a pixel amount, you can also
                            adjust this as a <strong>Dynamic</strong> element. You do this by specifying a percentage, or
                            an em, which is the phonetic pronounciation of the letter "M". So basically em is the height
                            of a capital M, which is 16 pixels. So 2 em = 32px 5.625em = 90px. rem or "root"em allows you
                            adjust the font property and ignore any inherited.

                            <strong>float</strong> used with an image will allow any text to wrap around the image instead
                            of being blocked off to a particular side. In CSS use float: "direction"; in which the
                            direction is which side you want the image to be on. <strong>Clear</strong> allows you to
                            clear a side of whatever element you use it with to "clear" that side of anything text.
